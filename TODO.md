\# TODO



\## Must-fix now

\- Timezone-aware business day key (vpDate) used end-to-end

\- Ensure !runnow generates tasks tagged with correct vpDate

\- UI shows Today/This week based on vpDate



\## Nice next

\- Persist tasks to a small DB or JSON store reliably

\- Add filter: Today / This week / All

\- Add dedupe rules for tasks so bot doesn’t spam duplicates
